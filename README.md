# Digital Clock Widget
A simple digital clock desktop widget built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and ElectronJS. This was inspired by Nasha Wanich's Little Calendar desktop app.

## My Design File
My Figma design file for the desktop widget: https://www.figma.com/design/Qgr8oTPTlI9EgzF15fjCQD/Digital-Clock-Widget?node-id=0-1&t=OyN7kHQT5WnQ1vzp-1

## How to use this widget

1. Clone this repo.
```
git clone https://github.com/sarani-tang/digital-clock-widget.git
cd digital-clock-widget
```

2. Make sure Node.js is installed, then run:
```
npm install
```
This will install ElectronJS if not already installed. 

3. Run the widget locally.
```
npm run start
```
This will open the digital clock widget locally powered by ElectronJS.
